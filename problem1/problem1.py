    Custom Feature to implement for instrument. This function would return the value of the feature you want to implement.

    1. Define it in getCustomFeatures, where you specify the identifier with which you want to access this feature.
    2. To finally use it in a meaningful way, specify this feature in getFeatureConfigDicts with appropirate feature params.
    Example for this is provided below.
    Params:
    updateNum: current iteration of update. For first iteration, it will be 1.
    time: time in datetime format when this update for feature will be run
    featureParams: A dictionary of parameter and parameter values your features computation might depend on.
                   You define the structure for this. just have to make sure these parameters are provided when
                   you wanted to actually use this feature in getFeatureConfigDicts
    featureKey: Name of the key this will feature will be mapped against.
